# Seperation of Refrigirants using Amino-acid-based ILs

## Molecular Simulation–Driven Evaluation for Efficient Refrigerant Separation

### Introduction
This repository presents a molecular simulation–based study aimed at evaluating the suitability of amino acid–based ionic liquids for refrigerant separation applications.

The project focuses on understanding how refrigerants (R32, R125, and R134a) interact with ionic liquids formed using Tetrabutylphosphonium (TBP) and amino acid anions, supporting the development of energy-efficient and environmentally responsible separation technologies.
